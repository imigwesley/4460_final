# CS 4460 Final Project Fall 2024
## Wesley Imig, Alex Thorne

### Brief Overview
In recent memory, the federal debt has ballooned in size. It has become such an issue that House Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky wears a debt counter pin to represent its size - over USD$34 trillion. We provide an interactive chart displaying the debt level each year.

All information comes from https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historical-tables/ .

# TODOs
- clean up code from lab 5 activity
- import/select relevant rows from excel file
- create chart axes and everything
- put debt as line with dots
- on hover over dots, show tooltip that says year and debt amount
- provide way to change which years show (slider?? other ways??)
- insert annotations for spikes (covid etc)
- styling??
