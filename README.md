# CS 4460 Final Project Fall 2024
## Wesley Imig, Alex Thorne

### Brief Overview
In recent memory, the federal debt has ballooned in size. It has become such an issue that House Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky wears a debt counter pin to represent its size - over USD$34 trillion. We provide an interactive chart displaying the debt level each year from 1940-2023.

### Run Instructions
Run `python -m http.server 8080` to start the python server.

All information comes from https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/historical-debt-outstanding/historical-debt-outstanding.

# TODOs
- provide way to change which years show (slider?? other ways??)
- insert annotations for spikes (covid etc)
- styling??
- clean up chart
